# ParkingGarage

Clone and import the following application, which simulates a Parking Garage. 

Instructions: 

- Start the program by running the Main class.
- Next, go to the Parking Garage class. Look at the ParkingGarage class' constructors, its public methods
- Override the Parking Garage class' ```toString``` to return more information about the garage's contents
- Test the changes to the Parking Garage's ```toString``` in the main method's public static void main method
- Create your own concrete subclasses of AbstractCar (Which methods will you have to override?)
- In the Parking Garage class, implement the ```parkCar()``` method and the ```removeCar`` method.
- Test the ParkingGarage's method operations in the main class.
